Hi there,

My name is Kenneth Kui, and I am a student at York University who is currently studying computer science.
I'm just a regular person who is passionate about coding and wants to take life one step at a time.

This Github page was made to archive and document my time as a programmer and showcase what I have done
or acomplished. I hope my projects increase in quantity and quality as I continue to learn more and more
about computer science.
